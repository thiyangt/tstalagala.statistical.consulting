## Hereâ€™s your roadmap for the semester!

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Create the data vectors
wn <- c("1", "")
date <- c("2024 - 10 - 11", "")
time <- c("3pm-5pm", "")
topic <- c("1. Introduction to Statistical Consulting", "2. Visual Communication")
Slides <- c("", "")
reading <- c("Taplin, R. H. (2003). Teaching statistical consulting before statistical methodology. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics, 45(2), 141-152.", "")

# Create the DataFrame
df <- data.frame(wn, date, time, topic, Slides, reading, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(df) <- c("Week Number",
                  "Date",
                  "Time",
                  "Topic",
                  "Slides",
                  "Reading")

# Display the DataFrame with fixed column widths
df %>%
  kable("html", escape = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "50px") %>%  # Adjust the width of the first column
  column_spec(2, width = "120px") %>% # Adjust the width of the date column
  column_spec(3, width = "50px") %>%  # Adjust the width of the time column
  column_spec(4, width = "300px") %>% # Adjust the width of the topic column
  column_spec(5, width = "50px") %>%  # Adjust the width of the Slides column
  column_spec(6, width = "400px")     # Adjust the width of the reading column
